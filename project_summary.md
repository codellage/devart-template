## Description
The idea is to build an API that can generate all the possible combinations of a 9x9 matrix where each field is 0 or 1. We know that the posible combinations is 2^81 but that is the whole concept. Images thats are nearly infinite, that will never repeat itself and that is going to be unique for everyone that look at it.

Anyone will be able to build there own matrix, can be physical or digital and connect to this api and get a "pigment" a prime number that assure that he can have his own unique version of the installation. 

## How to read it
- ### 1. Picture yourself in a REALLY weird situation.
- ### 2. Now, imagine somenone taken you a photo doing that.
- ### 3. Say the photo is in grayscale, and is 100x100. your picture will look something like this
[Add picture]
- ### 4. What we tried to show here, is that a picture is not more than combination of pixels. So doing all the combinations, we can have a picture of you doing all the possible things from every possible angle.
