# All the images in the universe (281)
(of 9x9 pixels)

## Description
Because the only thing that is constant in life is change, we created a project where that is the core . An art instalation that never repeated itself, and never will.
An art piece that couldn't exist by itself but exist because someone "request" to view it.

The only way to accomplish this was to create every possible image in the universe. And that is what we did... A pseudo-incremental algorithm that allows to generate every posible combination in a 9x9 matrix (in black and white) without ever repeating itself (unitl it dies).

It is because we can assure that there is no combination of 9x9 that we haven't generated or won't. that potentialy we already generated every possible master piece that can be created on "canvas" of that size.

## How it works

- A "Google App Engine" will host our algorithm code developed in "Go". 
- Anyone will be able to make "request".
- The server will response with a binary string of 81 characters. (0=white; 1=black)


## How will be displayed
In a completely dark room of 4 meters by 4 meters will be hanging from the ceiling at different height 81 tablets (preferbly nexus 7). Each one displaying an image get from the server



## Link to Prototype
The prototype will be ready soon
