Trying to put into words how many possible combinations are in small digital painting of 9x9

2,417,851,639,229,258,349,412,352

it doesn't look that bad. but if you put it in seconds it will look something like this

31536000 seconds in a year.

it will take

76,669,572,527,564,001 years

to display all my digital "paintings".
