The installation will be a 4m x 4m x 3m with the interior painted in black.

On some of the sides will have small windows where you'll be able to see inside of it.

Inside of the room you can find 81 tablets hanging from the ceiling at different heights, each one connected
to the "server" generating a new image.

The visual expectaction would be 
- from the outside: a big white box.
- from the inside: 81 white screen in different heights and depths,
 each one generating a different image, "floating" in space.
