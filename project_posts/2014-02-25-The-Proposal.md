The proposal is to generate all the images in the universe (of 9x9). And we don't believe we say enough, that these are 
NOT random QR 'look-a-like' codes. That each image was generate intentionally for that specific viewer with the only purpose
of generating all the possible combinations, making the viewer part of the installation because now his "owner" of that
image, because only what is gone can belong to us.

Lets put it in perspective:

There are 2^81 (2 to the power of 81) different combinations on a black and white images of 9 pixels by 9 pixles.

Lets assume we spend 1 second displaying it image.
it will take 2,417,851,639,229,258,349,412,352 seconds.

something like 76,669,572,527,564,001 years.

And assuming the age of universe since the Big Bang is of 13,800,000,000 years

We would need 5,555,766 universes.

Fun Fact: Say we display each image instead of the Google logo on every search. It will only take 153,339 years to display all the possible combinations.
