The proposal is to generate all the images in the universe (of 9x9). Lets put it in perspective:

There are 2^81 (2 to the power of 81) different combinations on a black and white image of 9 pixels by 9 pixles.

Lets assume we spend 1 second displaying it image.
it will take 2,417,851,639,229,258,349,412,352 seconds.

something like 76,669,572,527,564,001 years.

And assuming the age of universe since the Big Bang is of 13,800,000,000

We would need 5,555,766 universes.

Fun Fact: Say we display each image instead the Google logo of every search. It will only take 153,339 years to display all the possible combinations.
