The proposal is to generate all the images in the universe (of 9x9). Each image will be generated intentionally for that specific viewer with the only purpose
of completing all the possible combinations, making the viewer part of the installation by becoming "owner" of that
combinations.

Lets put it in perspective:

There are 2^81 (2 to the power of 81) different combinations on a black and white images of 9 pixels by 9 pixles.

Lets assume we spend 1 second displaying it image.
it will take 2,417,851,639,229,258,349,412,352 seconds.

something like 76,669,572,527,564,001 years.

And assuming the age of universe since the Big Bang is of 13,800,000,000 years

We would need 5,555,766 universes.

Fun Fact: Say we display each image instead of the Google logo on every search. It will only take 153,339 years to display all the possible combinations.
