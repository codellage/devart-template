81 character where the 0 is white and the 1 is black.

As you probably can imagine by now the calculations used to generate each UNIQUE image is pretty simple. But the demand is proportional to amount of people viewing it by the time they are spending.

We also have a javascript widget to whoever wants to put it on his website. And every second will display a differnt image to each user.
