As we explain before the amount of combinations make it nearly impossible to play with them. We are going to try to bring it little bit down to earth.

How many images will be able to create with 1 pixel and 1 bit?
Just two, one completly white the other one black.

What if we had 2 pixels? 4 images. Nothing exciting there.

25 pixels? 33,554,432 and still nearly no define figures.

Is 81 pixels, a 9x9 matrix which allows us to create the famous "Happy Face".

##From photography to painting.
When Photography was invented, many people thought that painting where going to dissapear. As a matter of fact the realistic painting tend to reduce, by the inevitable replacemente of the photo that was cheaper and faster, at the same time different art movements started to grow. such as impresionim, cubism and surrealism.

As we mention on different posts, a digital image is just a combination of pixels and colors immensely finite. this previous statement is what bring us back to our proposal of building a machine that can generate all the images in the universe.
