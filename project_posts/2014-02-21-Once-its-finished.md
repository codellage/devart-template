Once the exibition is finsihed, every tablet will be perfectly framed and given for free to anyone/anyplace that is willing to maintain it display to the public to see while all the different images are created.

A solar panel will be attach to it with the intention of make it run forever.

The basic idea of the project, that is that every new image is part of something of the totallity of all the image, will take its final form by being spread phisically.
