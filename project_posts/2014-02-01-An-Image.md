An image is no more than a bitmap. Each point may have different colors or light intensity. This way, the combination of all of them forms what is an image.
In a digital image each point its called a "pixel" and each pixel can be of a specific color. The quantities of colors availables for each  pixels it given by the color depth and it is specified by the amount of bits that the pixeld can support

In this project we will only be using 2 colors. black and white. that will limit the posibilties.

The rules of thumb to calculate all the possible combinations, would be:

colors ^ number of pixels  

(^ means "to power of")
